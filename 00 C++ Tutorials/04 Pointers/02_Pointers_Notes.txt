Common mistakes when working with pointers
Suppose, we want a pointer varPoint to point to the address of var. Then,

int var, *varPoint;

// Wrong! 
// varPoint is an address but var is not
varPoint = var;

// Wrong!
// &var is an address
// *varPoint is the value stored in &var
*varPoint = &var;

// Correct! 
// varPoint is an address and so is &var
varPoint = &var;

 // Correct!
// both *varPoint and var are values
*varPoint = var;


In most contexts, array names decay to pointers. In simple words, array names are converted to pointers. That's the reason why we can use pointers to access elements of arrays.

However, we should remember that pointers and arrays are not the same.

There are a few cases where array names don't decay to pointers.
