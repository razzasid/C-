Types of User-defined Functions in C++
In this tutorial, you will learn about different approaches you can take to solve a single problem using functions.

For better understanding of arguments and return in functions, user-defined functions can be categorised as:

* Function with no argument and no return value
* Function with no argument but return value
* Function with argument but no return value
* Function with argument and return value

Consider a situation in which you have to check prime number. This problem is solved below by making user-defined function in 4 different ways as mentioned above.


Which method is better?

All four programs above gives the same output and all are technically correct program.

There is no hard and fast rule on which method should be chosen.

The particular method is chosen depending upon the situation and how you want to solve a problem.
