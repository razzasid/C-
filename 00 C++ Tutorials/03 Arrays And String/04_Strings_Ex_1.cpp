/*Example 1: C++ String to read a word
C++ program to display a string entered by user.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char str[100];

    cout << "Enter a string: ";
    cin >> str;
    cout << "You entered: " << str << endl;

    cout << "\nEnter another string: ";
    cin >> str;
    cout << "You entered: " << str << endl;

    return 0;
}

/*Notice that, in the second example only "Programming" is displayed instead of "Programming is fun".

This is because the extraction operator >> works as scanf() in C and considers a space " " has a terminating character.*/
